Hey!

We wanted to let you know that we’re updating our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Paid Services Terms, and Community Guidelines. We periodically make these updates as our business evolves or to respond to new laws.

These changes will take effect on April 15, 2024.

Here are some highlights of what we’ve updated:

How we describe our services: Made it easier to understand how Discord works, the features we offer, and how our services can be personalized for you.
How we resolve disputes: Updated our informal dispute resolution process and our arbitration agreement. We work hard to make sure you always love Discord and hope there’s never a dispute!
How we approach privacy: Provided more information about privacy rights and how they are exercised. We also updated what data we collect and how we use it. Your privacy is important to us, and we try to limit what information we collect and give you control over your privacy on Discord.
How we explain our Community Guidelines: Added more context and made our guidelines easier to understand.
We encourage you to read the updated documents in full. We’ve also summarised important changes on our blog.

Dear Sir,

My name is Barr. Damian Roberts a solicitor and former legal attach? with a bank in Spain. I am contacting you because of an unclaimed deposit my late client left in a bank in Spain before his demise. The amount totaling $12.752M (TWELVE MILLION AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY-TWO THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS ONLY). It has been several years since he passed on with the entire family in a car crash.

I have been unable to locate any of his relatives because he was a foreigner. At the moment I have been given the last mandate to produce the next of kin to my late client for the claim and the release of the deposit or confiscation of the funds would be inevitable. I am asking you to partner with me in claiming the funds.

I seek to present you as the only beneficiary of the funds. It will be my responsibility to produce every document to pronounce you as the legal beneficiary of the funds. I assure you there is no risk associated with this. I shall explain in detail as soon as I have received your positive response. Please respond to my private email damian-roberts@gmx.com I am looking forward to receiving your response at the earliest.

Best regards
Damian Roberts (Esq)
